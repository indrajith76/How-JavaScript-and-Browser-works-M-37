## | 16 | What is single-threaded?
Javascript is a single-threaded and synchronous language.
>A single-thread language is one with a single call stack and a single memory heap. It means that it runs only one thing at a time. A stack is a continuous region of memory, allocating local context for each executed function. A heap is a much larger region, storing everything allocated dynamically.
